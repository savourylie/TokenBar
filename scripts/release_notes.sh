# Assemble release notes in two formats from hand-written, version-bound sources:
#
#   release-notes.txt  — plain text. Rendered by the Sparkle update dialog,
#                        embedded in appcast.xml, and shipped in the Tauri
#                        latest.json, so it must stay markdown-free. Ends
#                        with a deterministic "Thanks: @…" line when the
#                        release contains external PRs.
#   release-notes.md   — GitHub-flavored markdown for the GitHub release
#                        page, plus GitHub's own "New Contributors" and
#                        "Full Changelog" tail appended verbatim.
#
# Both bodies come from `release-notes/<tag>.{txt,md}`, written by hand before
# the tag is pushed. There is no generation step and no model: earlier versions
# asked DeepSeek to write these, which produced text that differed between the
# two formats and between a local preview and the CI run.
#
# The sources are bound to the tag by filename, and a missing one is a hard
# error rather than a fallback. That is the point of this design: the previous
# scheme read an unversioned `release-notes.override.{txt,md}`, so completing a
# release correctly left the current version's notes in the repository, armed
# to be published again by the next one. That misfire was caught by manual
# inspection before v1.16.0 and v1.17.0 and never by a mechanism.
#
# Inputs (env): GITHUB_REF_NAME (tag), GITHUB_REPOSITORY (owner/repo),
# VERSION, GH_TOKEN. The GitHub API supplies contributor attribution and the
# changelog tail; without a token those segments are simply absent, which is
# why a local run is still not proof of the CI artifact.
